  abstract        = {The circuit board manufacturing community is now ready to embrace the concept of moving probe in-circuit test systems, also known as Flying Probers. This is due not only to the ability of Flying Probers to eliminate the cost of fixturing, but also to their new ability to satisfy the overall test requirements. This opens up the opportunity to test a new class of boards that are not cost effective to test on fixture based systems, and were not able to be tested on previous Flying Probe test systems. Requirements such as prototype development, low to medium volume manufacturing, high net count boards, and field returns are examples of prime targets for Flying Probers. What then are the capabilities a user should look for in a Flying Prober that will insure its most effective overall use as a quick-turn around, highly flexible test tool? An attempt is made to answer this question.},

  abstract        = {Emerging wireless SOCs and SiPs are highly integrated devices containing logic, analog, RF, and even memory blocks. From a pure "can it be tested?" point of view, engineers are faced with a number of testing challenges. Add to that the economic challenges and the test community must find ways to test increasingly complex devices AND reduce cost of test. When approaching test, it is important to determine acceptable methodologies. For the purpose of this discussion, I propose three possible scenarios: 1) fault testing to verify that manufacturing processes produce a defect-free product; 2) functional testing to verify the SOC functions as intended; and 3) performance-based testing to verify the SOC meets published specs.},

  abstract        = {Over the last 2-3 years, there has been a major change in the IC industry from being predominantly "functional-based testing" to being predominantly "scan-based testing" (for new design starts). The question has now changed to: "can we completely avoid functional testing?" The same trends that are driving companies toward scan-based testing will also drive them to completely avoid functional-based testing. The advantages of structural testing cannot be fully exploited unless at-speed functional testing is avoided. The move away from functional testing will happen in stages. Some companies are already avoiding functional test for some test insertions - but not all. For example, some products are currently tested with scan-based, reduced pincount testing at wafer level - but still require full pincount, scan+functional testing at package test.},

  abstract        = {A system chip is defined as a complete system implemented on a single IC such that no peripheral chips are required. Thus, a system chip typically contains embedded core logic, embedded memory and analog components. A key enabling component of system chips is the re-use of existing design components sometimes called intellectual property cores or virtual components. Design re-use is narrowing the system chip design productivity gap but test and verification are now becoming the bottleneck. The key issues in testing core based system chips are how to optimally provide test access and test isolation to allow test methods and test vectors to be re-used for an embedded core, while ensuring that area, performance, test time and at-speed test requirements are met. While we are still in the early stages of developing a core test methodology that is widely accepted, two promising test re-use techniques are emerging: the test bus and test rail methods. Both approaches address the test bandwidth problem by allowing expandible test data access.},

The goal of this session is for a practicing test engineer or test manager to understand how these techniques work, how to apply them against different test problems, and how to use them as part of an overall test strategy. Examples drawn from Users' experience demonstrate how vectorless testing can dramatically reduce test cost and cycle time while maintaining or improving fault coverage.},
